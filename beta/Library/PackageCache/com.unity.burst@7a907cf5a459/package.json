    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Source file checksums are now included in pdb debugging files, so that Visual Studio can warn when source files differ from when the pdb was built\n- Added support for `HashCode.Combine`\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed hash generation error for derived default interface methods\n- Fixed resolution of local variable types in generic default interface methods\n- Fixed crash that could occur when a target method of `BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer` was already decorated with `[MonoPInvokeCallback]`. If this existing attribute existed in a namespace other than `AOT`, Burst's IL postprocessor would add a second `[MonoPInvokeCallback]`, resulting in a runtime crash on IL2CPP.\n- Fix crash when trying to Burst compile a project without any Bursted code with debug info enabled, when it has already been compiled without debug info before.\n- Fixed `BC1055: Unable to resolve the definition of the method ...` errors when compiling code using `in` method parameters for multiple CPU targets\n- Fixed an issue preventing debugging of managed methods that use direct call, regardless of whether Burst compilation is manually disabled\n- Fixed a rare concurrency issue in the entry point finder.\n\n### Added\n- [Android] Support for 16Kb page sizes\n\n### Removed\n\n### Known Issues"
